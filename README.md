# Assignment 3

A quick note: I decided to save all my screenshots onto a .docx file since it was the quickest way to save screen snippets. _However_ that caused some quality loss when I saved it off of the word document and into the `assignment-images` folder. They should still be readable, but if they aren't I also included the source document for where those pictures came from so that you can zoom in for more details.
